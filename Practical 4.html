4)Find out the Difference between list and tables.


Lists and tables are both used to organize and present information in HTML, but they serve different purposes and have distinct structures. Here are the key differences between lists and tables:

1. Purpose
Lists:

Lists are used to present a collection of items or points in a sequential or non-sequential manner.
They are ideal for displaying items that do not require a structured format, such as bullet points, steps in a process, or a series of related items.
Tables:

Tables are used to present data in a structured format, typically in rows and columns.
They are ideal for displaying related data that can be compared, such as statistics, schedules, or any dataset that requires organization into categories.
2. Structure
Lists:

Lists can be ordered (<ol>) or unordered (<ul>).
Each item in a list is defined using the <li> tag.
Example of an unordered list:
html

Verify
Run
Copy code
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
Tables:

Tables are defined using the <table> tag.
They consist of rows (<tr>), header cells (<th>), and data cells (<td>).
Example of a simple table:
html

Verify
Run
Copy code
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
3. Formatting
Lists:

Lists are typically displayed as bullet points (unordered) or numbered items (ordered).
They do not have a grid-like structure and are more flexible in terms of layout.
Tables:

Tables have a grid-like structure with defined rows and columns.
They can include borders, cell padding, and other formatting options to enhance readability and organization.
4. Use Cases
Lists:

Use lists for:
Navigation menus
To-do lists
Steps in a process
Features or benefits of a product
Tables:

Use tables for:
Data comparison (e.g., sales figures, statistics)
Schedules (e.g., class timetables)
Financial reports
Any structured data that benefits from a row-column format
